Stock Market Prediction using ML and Deep Learning Models

Steps involved in this Project:
1) Data Scraping
Got Data from online resources that can be helpful for stock prediction. Used Beautiful Soup for scraping news articles from online news websites and TwitterScraper Library for getting data. We can also scrape stock recos from sites like economic times for better performance. 

2) Pre-Processing
Remove unnecessary tweets that are of no use. This Step depends on the data we get from twitter and company which we target for prediction.

3) Visualization
Visualize the data for getting better insight of the collected data.

4) Train the Model and Predict
Last Step in this list comprises of training different models and saving the best model. We can use both ML and Deep Learning models for that purpose. Predict the price for any given day.
